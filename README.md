# Latent Purposes in Mobile Apps Identification
This Project aims at identifying the latent purposes of mobile applications by TF-IDF and Topic Models with LDA.

1. Read data and transform them by TF-TDF normalization with less weight on stop words
2. Build topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
3. Visualize the results by t-SNE
